 * Often in PhenoTips you see fat ScriptServices that pass methods onto the actual Component with the business logic.
 * In this case, both the Component and the ScriptService implement a "proxy" functionality, where they just
 * marshall the method calls onto the actual {{@link org.phenotips.variantstore.VariantStore}} implementation.
